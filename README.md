# CSSD Sterilization Management System  


## 📌 Project Overview  
The **CSSD Sterilization Management System** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to digitize and streamline the sterilization process in hospital Central Sterile Supply Departments (CSSD). The application helps hospital staff manage instrument sterilization requests, track sterilized items, generate reports, and optimize workflow efficiency.  

This project ensures that all instruments are properly sterilized, stored, and dispatched efficiently, reducing human errors and improving patient safety.
